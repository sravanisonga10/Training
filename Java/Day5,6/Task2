Create a Shape class with a method area() and extend it with Circle and Rectangle classes overriding the area() method appropriately.

public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double area();
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
